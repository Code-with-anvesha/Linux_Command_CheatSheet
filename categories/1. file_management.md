### 11. zip and unzip commands
___
The zip command compresses one or multiple files into a ZIP archive, reducing their size. Here’s the
```bash
 syntax:

zip [options] zip_file_name file1 file2
```
To extract a compressed file into your current working directory, use the unzip command like so:
```bash
unzip [options] zip_file_name
```

### 12. grep command
___
Global regular expression print or grep lets you search specific lines from a file using keywords. It is useful for filtering large data like logs. The syntax looks as follows:
```bash

grep [options] keyword [file]
```
You can also filter data from another utility by piping it to the grep command. For example, the following searches file.txt from the ls command’s output:

```bash
ls | grep "file.txt"
```


### 13. sed command
___
Use the sed command to search and replace patterns in files quickly. The basic syntax looks like this:
```bash
sed [options] 'subcommand/new_pattern/target_pattern' input_file
```
You can replace a string in multiple files simultaneously by listing them. Here’s an example of a sed command that changes red in colors.txt and hue.txt with blue:
```bash
sed 's/red/blue' colors.txt hue.txt
```

### 14. head command
___
Use the head command to print the first few entries of a file. The basic syntax is as follows:
```bash
head [options] file_name
```
You can also print the first few lines of another command’s output by piping it like so:
```bash
command | head [options]
```

### 15. tail command
___
The tail command is the opposite of head, allowing you to print the last few lines from files or another utility’s output. Here are the syntaxes:

```bash
tail [options] file_name

```
```bash
command | tail [options]

```
The tail utility also has the same option as head. For example, we will extract the last five lines from the ping command’s output:

```bash

ping -c 10 8.8.8.8 | tail -n 5

```

### 16. awk command
___

The awk command searches and manipulates regular expression patterns in a file. Here’s the basic syntax:
```bash
awk '/regex pattern/{action}' input_file.txt
```
