To extract a compressed file into your current working directory, use the unzip command like so:

### 12. grep command
Global regular expression print or grep lets you search specific lines from a file using keywords. It is useful for filtering large data like logs. The syntax looks as follows:

You can also filter data from another utility by piping it to the grep command. For example, the following searches file.txt from the ls command’s output:

ls | grep "file.txt"
