 ### üñ•Ô∏è Shell Scripting Basics

This section covers the very basic concepts of writing Shell Scripts (.sh files) in Linux.

___

 ### 1. üìù What is a Shell Script?
___
Definition:
A shell script is a file containing a series of Linux commands to automate tasks.
 ``` bash
Example file: myscript.sh

#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, Anvesha! This is my first script."

Run the script:

bash myscript.sh
```

### 2.  ‚úèÔ∏è Writing a Basic Script
___
Steps:

Create a file with .sh extension.

Add #!/bin/bash at the top (this tells system it's a bash script).

Write commands below.

```bash

Example:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Today's Date:"
date
```

### 3. üì¶ Variables in Shell
___
Create and use variables:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
name="Anvesha"
echo "Hello, $name!"

```

### 4. üîÑ If-Else Condition
___
Use conditionals in scripts:


```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number:"
read num

if [ $num -gt 10 ]
then
    echo "Number is greater than 10."
else
    echo "Number is 10 or less."
fi
```


### 5. üîÅ Loops in Shell
___
For Loop Example:
 ```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in 1 2 3
do
    echo "Number: $i"
done
```


### 6. While loop
___
```bash
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]
do
  echo "Count is $count"
  ((count++))
done

```
### 7. ‚úã Taking Input from User
___
Using read command:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter your favorite color:"
read color
echo "Your favorite color is $color!"
```

### 8. ‚öôÔ∏è Making Script Executable

Before running directly, make your script executable:
```bash
chmod +x myscript.sh
./myscript.sh
```

### 8. Functions

Define functions to organize your code and reuse common tasks.

```bash
Example:

#!/bin/bash
greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1!"
}
greet "Aashi"
```

### 9. Command Line Arguments

 Use command line arguments to pass data to your script when running it.

```bash
Example:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Script Name: $0"
echo "First Argument: $1"
echo "Total Arguments: $#"
```

### 10. Exit Status and Error Handling

Understand how the exit status works and use it to signal errors.

```bash
Example:

#!/bin/bash
if [ -f "myfile.txt" ]; then
    echo "File exists."
    exit 0
else
    echo "File not found!"
    exit 1
fi
```

### 11.Simple Calculator Script

```bash

#!/bin/bash

echo "Simple Calculator"
read -p "Enter first number: " a
read -p "Enter second number: " b
read -p "Choose operation (+ - * /): " op

case $op in
  +) result=$((a + b)) ;;
  -) result=$((a - b)) ;;
  \*) result=$((a * b)) ;;
  /) 
    if [ $b -ne 0 ]; then
      result=$((a / b))
    else
      echo "Division by zero is not allowed."
      exit 1
    fi ;;
  *) echo "Invalid operator"; exit 1 ;;
esac

echo "Result: $result"
```


### 12.Disk Space Monitor
```bash
#!/bin/bash

threshold=80

usage=$(df / | grep / | awk '{ print $5 }' | sed 's/%//g')

if [ $usage -ge $threshold ]; then
  echo "Warning: Disk usage is above $threshold% (Current: $usage%)"
else
  echo "Disk usage is under control (Current: $usage%)"
fi
```
