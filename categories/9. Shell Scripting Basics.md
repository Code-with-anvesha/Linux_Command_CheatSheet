 ### 🖥️ Shell Scripting Basics

This section covers the very basic concepts of writing Shell Scripts (.sh files) in Linux.


 ### 1. 📝 What is a Shell Script?

Definition:
A shell script is a file containing a series of Linux commands to automate tasks.
 ``` bash
Example file: myscript.sh

#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, Anvesha! This is my first script."

Run the script:

bash myscript.sh
```

### 2. ✏️ Writing a Basic Script

Steps:

Create a file with .sh extension.

Add #!/bin/bash at the top (this tells system it's a bash script).

Write commands below.

```bash

Example:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Today's Date:"
date
```

### 3. 📦 Variables in Shell

Create and use variables:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
name="Anvesha"
echo "Hello, $name!"

```

### 4. 🔄 If-Else Condition

Use conditionals in scripts:


```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number:"
read num

if [ $num -gt 10 ]
then
    echo "Number is greater than 10."
else
    echo "Number is 10 or less."
fi
```


### 5. 🔁 Loops in Shell

For Loop Example:
 ```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in 1 2 3
do
    echo "Number: $i"
done
```


### 6. While loop

```bash
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]
do
  echo "Count is $count"
  ((count++))
done

```
### 7. ✋ Taking Input from User

Using read command:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter your favorite color:"
read color
echo "Your favorite color is $color!"
```

### 8. ⚙️ Making Script Executable

Before running directly, make your script executable:
```bash
chmod +x myscript.sh
./myscript.sh
```

### 8. Functions

Define functions to organize your code and reuse common tasks.

```bash
Example:

#!/bin/bash
greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1!"
}
greet "Aashi"
```

### 9. Command Line Arguments

Description: Use command line arguments to pass data to your script when running it.

```bash
Example:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Script Name: $0"
echo "First Argument: $1"
echo "Total Arguments: $#"
