 ### 🖥️ Shell Scripting Basics

This section covers the very basic concepts of writing Shell Scripts (.sh files) in Linux.


 ### 1. 📝 What is a Shell Script?

Definition:
A shell script is a file containing a series of Linux commands to automate tasks.
 ``` bash
Example file: myscript.sh

#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, Anvesha! This is my first script."

Run the script:

bash myscript.sh
```

### 2. ✏️ Writing a Basic Script

Steps:

Create a file with .sh extension.

Add #!/bin/bash at the top (this tells system it's a bash script).

Write commands below.

```bash

Example:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Today's Date:"
date
```

### 3. 📦 Variables in Shell

Create and use variables:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
name="Anvesha"
echo "Hello, $name!"

```
