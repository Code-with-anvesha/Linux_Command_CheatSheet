 ### 🖥️ Shell Scripting Basics

This section covers the very basic concepts of writing Shell Scripts (.sh files) in Linux.


 ### 1. 📝 What is a Shell Script?

Definition:
A shell script is a file containing a series of Linux commands to automate tasks.
 ``` bash
Example file: myscript.sh

#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, Anvesha! This is my first script."

Run the script:

bash myscript.sh
```

### 2. ✏️ Writing a Basic Script

Steps:

Create a file with .sh extension.

Add #!/bin/bash at the top (this tells system it's a bash script).

Write commands below.

```bash

Example:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Today's Date:"
date
```

### 3. 📦 Variables in Shell

Create and use variables:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
name="Anvesha"
echo "Hello, $name!"

```

### 4. 🔄 If-Else Condition

Use conditionals in scripts:


```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number:"
read num

if [ $num -gt 10 ]
then
    echo "Number is greater than 10."
else
    echo "Number is 10 or less."
fi
```


### 5. 🔁 Loops in Shell

For Loop Example:
 ```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in 1 2 3
do
    echo "Number: $i"
done
```

### 6. ✋ Taking Input from User

Using read command:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter your favorite color:"
read color
echo "Your favorite color is $color!"
```
